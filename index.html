          <h2>Hi, I'm Herwig,</h2>

          <p>I would describe myself as a quite random person, so would others.
            I don't have a software or IT background (yet). My studies took place
            at the Maritime Academy of Antwerp to become a captain of a merchant
            vessel. My previous job was in 3D printing, something completely different.
            Now making the switch to Java is yet again a jump into the unknown,
            but I am really looking forward to it.</p>

          <p>The things that interest me most are the ones I don't understand.
            Which is still a lot. I always wonder how do they do this? How can I
            do that?<br/> In pursuit of my curiosity, I tend to change hobbies every
            now and then. Going from learning how to dry and cure meat to melting
            and casting aluminium in a homemade forge. My latest project was
            working with leather to make fantasy-style armour (and a purse for my
            mother, but let's focus on the armour). I will not say that I am always
            successful at the things I try, but I always get a kick when something
            works for the first time!</p>

          <p>Check out the Projects page for some low-res pictures of a couple of my projects I tried over the years.</p>
